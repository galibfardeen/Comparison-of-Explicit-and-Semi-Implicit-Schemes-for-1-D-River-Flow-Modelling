# Comparison-of-Explicit-and-Semi-Implicit-Schemes-for-1-D-River-Flow-Modelling
This project simulates **unsteady one-dimensional flow in the Halda River** using finite-difference methods under the course *Numerical Modelling in Water and Sediment Transport*. The models implement **explicit, kinematic-wave, and routing schemes** based on the Saint-Venant equations to analyze variations in **water level and velocity** over time. Boundary conditions are read from real or synthetic hydrographs, and stability is maintained through CFL-based time stepping. The work demonstrates how different numerical formulations influence wave propagation and flow behavior in river systems.
